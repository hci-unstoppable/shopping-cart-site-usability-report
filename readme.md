## Team Unstoppable: Project 03 Usability Report # 2

## Individual Feedback reports

#### Jakub Urbaniak
The first usability report that I did with my subject allowed me to scratch out many of the obvious small issues my website was having. There was a lot of minor tweaks and issues the site had that I was able to go back into and change. Primarily
the button placement/appearance of the site was subject to change, and the math
in the cart was something that had to change. After these changes were made, I had my
second usability test with a new user. This is the one I will be primarily talking about
here.
Like the previous usability report, the tester gave his first impressions on the site.
He stated that the site gave off very rustic and old vibes. So this tells me that if
I am going for a different feel of the site, I should change things around. And
personally, I do think that is something I would change in the future if I was going to
go back and change the site as a whole. In addition to this, he mentioned that the
cart total placement was in an awkward position, so in the future I would move that to a
more easily legible location. Outside of those two input for the home page, the user
was fairly satisfied with the content on the page. It was easy to look through and
simply to use. The issues began back up after the first page. Some of the validation
in the following pages were not working as intended, and the site would refresh sometimes
when trying to input data. These are two more issues that I would have to work on to
try to get the site working more smoothly. And the final point of interest that the user
would want for me to go over is the final confirmation screen. It is very lackluster and
would benefit from a heavy visual overhaul.
All in all, the second usability report was just as impactful as the first, as it brought
to light many issues that we tended to overlook. If I planned on going back and changing
things in the site, this test brought to me all the things to primarily focus on.
These being: visual overhauls on the overall site layout, complete change of the confirmation
page, and fixing the validation issues that our site had.

My first usability report that I did with my tester revealed some issues with our site. Disclaimer but this test was done on my personal laptop as the tester did not have his own device at the time of testing. The most distracting
issue to him was that our prices would spew out an overflow of decimal places. He also had issues navigating the site and found inputting the date for his credit card to be cumbersome. The decimal issue would be fixed before the second round of testing by utilizing toFixed to force the prices to display two decimal places. My tester also pointed out that the navigation would benefit from previous and next options. Lastly, he recommended that after successful completion of checkout that the page redirects back to the homepage.
The second usability report I did with my second tester was just as useful. He managed to successfully break the site which is extremely valuable data as it shows vulnerabilities. My second tester recommended that there were some form of validation for the inputted data for shipping and billing fields to prevent fraud. He also mentioned some navigation issues namely that for him, the navigation button to go to the shipping page wasn't working correctly for him. I cannot explain how that occurred as the navigation button worked fine for other testers. Also, he tested this on his own device and with the page not fully maximized which highlighted valuable feedback with how the site looks and operates at a different browser size.
Overall, both usability reports and tests were extremely useful and some of their feedback were successfully implemented into the site. I thank that both testers were willing to let themselves and their feedback be recorded for the sole purpose of this project.

For this round of usability testing, I utilized a tablet; my first, on a desktop, ended up giving me a lot of feedback that got me hyper-focused on making the desktop experience fantastic while neglecting mobile for my contributions — this felt like a good chance to rectify that. Some of the feedback was reminiscent of the first round of usability testing. On mobile, buttons are still small enough to be an inconvenience, the layout of some things make them hard to notice, the page can sometimes delete data and just refresh rather than navigating to the next page when the ‘next page button is hit’, etc.

At the beginning of my test, when the user was prompted to add things to the cart, there was a moment of uncertainty on how they did this; it was resolved very quickly and did not come up as a complaint at any point, so think this was a one-off. What did seem to be an issue, however, was the placement of the total in the bottom left corner; it took them a more significant amount of time to notice this. The largest issue to crop up was that the button for moving from the shop page to the shipping information page seemed to malfunction; I’ve since confirmed it definitely works, but it seems that on mobile sometimes it needs to be hit twice in rapid succession, which is inconvenient at best and makes the user lose their cart at worst. Something the user was rather disappointed by was the lack of ‘same as shipping information’ checkbox on the billing page; it’s an inconvenience to have to reenter the information if it matches, and is expected at this point. Additionally, user was confused by the lack of a navigation option back to the main page from the confirmation page.
